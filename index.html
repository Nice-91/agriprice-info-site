          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <p>AgriPrice (AbahinziHub) connects farmers and buyers across Rwanda so that everyone can trade fairly and confidently. Through our platform, users can post products, compare prices, and contact sellers directly—all in one convenient place.</p>

          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>Our mission is to empower farmers and buyers by providing accurate, daily market prices and a trusted space to post products and complete transactions. We believe fair prices and clear information help communities thrive — farmers earn more and buyers find reliable supply at the best price.</p>

          <img src="images/vision.jpeg" alt="Vision">
          <h2>Our Vision</h2>
          <p>We envision a future where information is available to everyone: where every farmer knows the true market value of their harvest and can easily reach buyers, and where buyers can compare offers across markets before making decisions. By making pricing transparent and connections simple, we aim to strengthen local food systems and rural livelihoods.</p>

          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>The idea for AgriPrice came from a simple observation: farmers often sell at low prices because they don’t know what other markets are paying. We began by mapping daily prices in nearby markets and building a small prototype so farmers could list their products. Today, AgriPrice brings those tools to more farmers and buyers — helping them post stock, compare prices across markets, and contact each other directly.</p>
